# UI

This is just a minimalistic static web site run with Node.js.

The site consists of react components and serves as a sample source for the crawler app.

## To start the web server:

  * Install dependencies with `npm i`
  * Compile the react app with `npm run build`
  * Start the server with `npm run start`

Now you can visit [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) from your browser and marvel at this "beautiful" web site.
